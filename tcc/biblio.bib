    abstract         = {P4 is a high-level language for programming protocol-independent packet processors. P4 works in conjunction with SDN control protocols like OpenFlow. In its current form, OpenFlow explicitly specifies protocol headers on which it operates. This set has grown from 12 to 41 fields in a few years, increasing the complexity of the specification while still not providing the flexibility to add new headers. In this paper we propose P4 as a strawman proposal for how OpenFlow should evolve in the future. We have three goals: (1) Reconfigurability in the field: Programmers should be able to change the way switches process packets once they are deployed. (2) Protocol independence: Switches should not be tied to any specific network protocols. (3) Target independence: Programmers should be able to describe packet-processing functionality independently of the specifics of the underlying hardware. As an example, we describe how to use P4 to configure a switch to add a new hierarchical label.},

    abstract = {We describe Bro, a stand-alone system for detecting network intruders in real-time by passively monitoring a network link over which the intruder's traffic transits. We give an overview of the system's design, which emphasizes high-speed (FDDI-rate) monitoring, real-time notification, clear separation between mechanism and policy, and extensibility. To achieve these ends, Bro is divided into an `event engine' that reduces a kernel-filtered network traffic stream into a series of higher-level events, and a `policy script interpreter' that interprets event handlers written in a specialized language used to express a site's security policy. Event handlers can update state information, synthesize new events, record information to disk, and generate real-time notifications via syslog. We also discuss a number of attacks that attempt to subvert passive monitoring systems and defenses against these, and give particulars of how Bro analyzes the six applications integrated into it so far: Finger, FTP, Portmapper, Ident, Telnet and Rlogin. The system is publicly available in source code form.}

    abstract = {SDN and OpenFlow reshaped the way we configure forwarding devices and determine network behavior, by offering an open interface upon which apps like routing, monitoring, etc. can be built. SDN/OpenFlow helped break network ``ossification'' and unleash evolution, by enabling one to effectively think networking from top-down. It evidenced, however, a subtle but important problem: networking evolution is also hampered by the inability to change switch behavior, which forces one to build systems constrained from the bottom up. This scenario can change dramatically with the re-emergence of programmable data planes, and languages like POF and P4. Although recent, these languages proved to be very influential, powering several contributions towards flexible and customizable forwarding devices. In this paper, we survey the literature on data plane programmability, from early concepts (like Active Networks) to state-of-the-art solutions. We then dive into research questions that more recent work (especially P4) have uncovered: how to deploy and manage custom switch programs in large-scale networks? Can we improve services like monitoring and security with programmable data planes? Can we make network operation more dependable? As another contribution, we organize and discuss opportunities and challenges with potential to influence research in the field, from the perspective of network and service operations and management.},

    abstract  = {A flexible and programmable forwarding plane is essential to maximize the value of Software-Defined Networks (SDN). In this paper, we propose Protocol-Oblivious Forwarding (POF) as a key enabler for highly flexible and programmable SDN. Our goal is to remove any dependency on protocol-specific configurations on the forwarding elements and enhance the data-path with new stateful instructions to support genuine software defined networking behavior. A generic flow instruction set (FIS) is defined to fulfill this purpose. POF helps to lower network cost by using commodity forwarding elements and to create new value by enabling numerous innovative network services. We built both hardware-based and open source software-based prototypes to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of POF. We report the preliminary evaluation results and the insights we learnt from the experiments. POF is future-proof and expressive. We believe it represents a promising direction to evolve the OpenFlow protocol and the future SDN forwarding elements.},
